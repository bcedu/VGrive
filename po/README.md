# Translating VGrive

Anyone may propose translations for VGrive. You can do so by creating and editing the relevant `.po` file for your language above. Don't forget to add your language code in `LINGUAS`. Many translation tools can help automate this process. When your translation is ready, propose it as a pull request against this project and it will be reviewed. If it looks sane and builds correctly, it will be merged in.

When translating you may encounter a situation where you have to decide between several ways of saying the same thing. In these situations we refer to the Ubuntu [general translator guide](https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/Guide), and for language specific issues we follow Ubuntu's [team translation guidelines](https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/ubuntu-translators). Following these guides ensure uniform translations, while also allowing anyone to contribute.
